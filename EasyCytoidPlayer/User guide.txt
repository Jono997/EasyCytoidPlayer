Thank you for using Easy Cytoid Player

The first time you open Cytoid Player, you will need to set it up. To do so, open Easy Cytoid Player and click on the "Options". From there, insert the path to the Cytoid Player application. You can click on the button next to the text box to browse to it rather than typing it by hand. You can also insert to path to the Cytus 2 Player application as well as or instead of Cytoid Player.

Afterwards, Easy Cytoid Player is ready to use. Simply paste the path to the chart's folder into the correct text box (or click the button and browse for it), select your difficulty from the dropdown and click the button to preview your chart in Cytoid Player.
